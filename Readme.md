# ⚔️ Shadow Awakened: A Solo-Leveling Inspired System 👥🔥

Welcome to **Shadow Awakened**, a custom-built leveling and power-evolution system created with passion by two dedicated developers — **[@Krish-saga](https://github.com/Krish-saga)** & **[@abhinosin](https://github.com/abhinosin)**. 🚀

> 🌑 Inspired by the legendary manhwa *Solo Leveling*, our system isn't just a clone — it's a **rebirth** of the leveling concept in a completely original and interactive way. 💡

## 🌟 Core Concept

Shadow Awakened is a **player-centric evolution system** where users start from being an ordinary human and rise to unimaginable heights by completing missions, collecting shadows, defeating bosses, and awakening hidden abilities. 🧠🕹️

> "From E-rank to God-tier — you don't level up, **you evolve**." ⚡
